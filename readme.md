#  ImageRender
![Site name](imagerendered.herokuapp.com/)
***
An ImageRender created using Flask.

##  What is it?
---We  built a flask api along with a basic 2 page interface, which has the following functionality:

An interface to upload images and when we click the "submit" button, it shows a new page with the name of the uploaded image.

We set a throttle for api call rate, let's say 5 / min.

Continuing from Part A, build a google auth based login based authorization.

In addition to the interface functionality we have rendered the uploaded image in the interface. Also, we implement a zoom functionality, wherein, a small window pane pops-up and shows a zoomed-in image as one hovers over the image using mouse cursor (look into the zoom-in functionality.
