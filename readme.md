#  ImageRender
![Site name](imagerendered.herokuapp.com/)
***
An ImageRender created using Flask.

##  What is it?
---
We have to build a flask api along with a basic 2 page interface, which has the following functionality:
1. Simple interface to upload images and when you click the "submit" button, it shows a new page with the name of the uploaded image.
2. Put in place a throttle for api call rate, let's say 5 / min. Please share an api script to test the throttle limit.
3. Continuing from Part A, build a google auth based login based authorization. 
4. In addition to the interface functionality we have to render the uploaded image in the interface. Also, implement a zoom functionality, wherein, a small window pane pops-up and shows a zoomed-in image as one hovers over the image using mouse cursor (look into the zoom-in functionality.
